[Google Scholar][1]: Where you can see all the spicy analytics about my pubs! :D

These are only my publications that have been peer reviewed and accepted. If you would like a more recent and complete list of my projects, please visit my research interests page.
Those projects will have their 'prime time' moments on this page soon enough.
