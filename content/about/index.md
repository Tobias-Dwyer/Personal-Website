I am a Chemical Engineering PhD student at the University of Michigan working in Professor Sharon Glotzer's Group. Here I work on the theory of entropy in colloidal systems and build models to predict the crystal structures self assembled by hard and patchy particles. 

I went to undergrad at the University of Arkansas where I received my Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering. During that time I worked in the lab of Professor Lauren Greenlee. I also had two REUs through the national science foundation, on at the University of Texas, Austin, under Professor John Ekerdt, and another at Tulane University under Professor Hank Ashbaugh.
