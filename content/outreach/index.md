Mentorship: 

I currently work on several outreach/mentorship programs at the University of Michigan. Among them are SLATE, an organization mentoring middle and high school students in the Ann Arbor area, Posse, an organization that works with current undergraduate students to thrive in college, and as a peer mentor for incoming chemical engineering graduate students. 

I also mentor 2 undergraduate researchers, graduating winter semester 2022, who conduct their own research in the Glotzer group.

Curriculum:

In the wake of the BLM protests in 2020, several graduate students, including myself, have begun work on adding needed but missing topics to the chemical engineering curriculum. Working with faculty, we work to add topics such as environmental racism, and social justice to the classic chemical engineering curriculum and ask students to consider important ethical questions about their actions as engineers. We have added these issues to a diverse set of course from fluid mechanics, our senior design courses, and some of our graduate courses.
